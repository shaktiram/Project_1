            <p>Most modern tablet ads emphasize how the iPad or Surface can become your daily device, completely replacing the functions of a traditional Mac or PC. But can a tablet really replace your laptop or desktop? Over the last few weeks I set out
                to find the answer after switching over to the 12.9-inch iPad Pro for many of my daily tasks.
            </p>
            <p>Both Apple and Microsoft are currently running various ads attempting to sell the idea that people can use their iPad, particularly the iPad Pro — or in Microsofts world, the Surface — as both a laptop and a tablet.</p>
            <p>Over the past month, I’ve been using a combination of my MacBook Pro and the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, and I’ve concluded that Apple really does makes a compelling argument that the Pro is capable of offering the same functionality as a standard
                Mac.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid_6">
            <p>MobileSyrup’s office is located in downtown Toronto and I live within about an hour drive of the city. Unfortunately driving into the city at 7:30am is torture, so I typically take the Go Train. It’s now 7:39am and the train is pulling into
                the station. I grab a seat and pull out my iPad. My commute on the train is about an hour, so I have a decent amount of time to get some work done, or watch Netflix.</p>
            <p>The particular iPad Pro I’m using right now features LTE connectivity, so I’m able to check my email or watch an episodes of the Walking Dead on the train (if I wasn’t using the LTE version I could always tether to my iPhone). I sometimes
                use this time to catch up on Sunday’s Walking Dead episode. Is Glen okay? That episode was a whirl wind.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid_4">
            <p>As the work day draws to a close I typically do one last check of my emails, an incredible easy task to complete with the iPad. Next, I use the Pro one last time to schedule content in order to fill out our weekend social presence. Thanks
                to the the iPad Pro’s multitasking feature this process is a breeze. And, I’m done! That was easier than I expected.</p>
            <p>For many people, depending on their job and expectations, the iPad Pro, whether it’s the 9.7-inch or 12.9-inch iteration, could actually be a laptop replacement. For me, however, I’ve found it to be a solid supplement to my Mac.</p>
